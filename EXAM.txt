EXAM OPTIMIZE YOUR AUTOMATION SKILLS


GENERAL

The System Under Test (SUT) is http://opensource.demo.orangehrmlive.com. This
is a test site and you can do there whatever you want. All exercises must be
executed within Katalon Studio and of course you should create test cases,
test suites and so on. The Katalon Studio project should be stored as a
project in your personal GitHub account, so it can be verified later on.

In the exam there is no need to use the Spy Web. The Record Web is not
necessary too. All Web objects who need to be used are already in the Object
Repository.


EXERCISE 1 - PIM -> Create employees

Login with Admin and create 5 employees: first name "pizza" and last name
"employee_X_Y_Z" where X is the number of the pizza session, Y your user
number and Z between 1 and 5. Check the existence of your employee before and
after the creation.

Detailed steps:

- Create a test case PIM/CreateEmployee with a first name and last name
  test case variable (employeeFirstName and employeeLastName respectively).

- Call the existing test case PIM/FindEmployee to verify that the employee
  does not yet exist. Use this piece of code:

    String employeeName = employeeFirstName + ' ' + employeeLastName

    int count = WebUI.callTestCase(findTestCase('PIM/FindEmployee'), [('employeeName') : employeeName, ('matchExact') : true])

    assert count == 0

- Call the existing test case Common/GoToUrl to go to
	URL http://opensource.demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/pim/addEmployee.

- Enter the information for the first name and last name and save it.

- Verify that the employee just entered exists by calling the existing
  test case PIM/FindEmployee.

- Create a spreadsheet in the Data Files directory with first name, last
  name and complete name for your five employees.

- Create a Test Suite PIM/CreateEmployees and use the data driven
  approach to combine the spreadsheet and the test case.


EXERCISE 2 - PIM -> Delete employees

In this exercise you should remove all employees who have been created in the
previous exercise. Be cautious: do not remove other employees! Check the
existence of your employee before and after the deletion.

Detailed steps:

- Create a test case PIM/DeleteEmployee with a (complete) name test case
  variable (employeeName).

- Call the existing test case PIM/FindEmployee to verify that the employee
  does exist.

- Click the button delete and say OK when a dialog pops up.

- Verify that the employee has been deleted by calling the existing test case
  PIM/FindEmployee.

- Create a Test Suite PIM/DeleteEmployees and use the data driven
  approach to combine the spreadsheet and the test case.
	

EXERCISE 3 - Best practices

The answers to the questions below can be found in the Word document "Improve
your automation skills" in Microsoft Teams.

Which best practices have you used? Describe them in the table below:

Best practice  Example
-------------	 -------

Data driven approach => list of employee
Call Test Case => reuse test case 

EXERCISE 4 - Cleanup / efficiency

Ensure that in all test cases the browser is only opened when necessary and
never closed by you. Remove all unnecessary objects.


EXERCISE 5 - Git

Do not forget to store everything in Git. Do not store the reports.
